I keep it short:

-   No harassment
-   Be welcoming (not everything is nail, accept people having more complicated setups and requiring special (internal) methods or are beginners).
-   Accept communication mistakes; intention matters (First we are not all nativespeakers, nor we should blame people for unintended mistakes against some etiquette)
-   Those who twist words or opinions to make others feel uncomfortable are not welcome. This is mobbing and will not be tolerated in any way
