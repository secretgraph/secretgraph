# Tags

Note: tags are not included in signature hash, therefore they are not authenticated

## tags used for preview purposes

-   name/~name: sets the name in the sidebar/title (default client)
-   mime/~mime: unencrypted/encrypted mime of content.

## Special tags and flags

-   key_hash: 1 needed except for keys (autogenerated) and public contents, format algorithm:hash
-   key: special, required tag for PrivateKey. Contains encrypted shared secret
-   freeze: cannot change content after viewing/fetching (use of ContentAction group fetch/view), freeze will be transformed to immutable
-   immutable: cannot change content. Deletion only possible for manage permission
    -   to remove this flag manage_update permission is required and can only done via metadata update
    -   immutable does not prevent action updates (via metadata update)
-   name/~name: unencrypted/encrypted name of content. Sets content-disposition on view (in case it is unencrypted or the key was provided)
-   mime/~mime: unencrypted/encrypted mime of content. Sets content mime on view (in case it is unencrypted or the key was provided)

## transfer

-   ~transfer_url: target url
-   ~transfer_header: header=value

### encrypted tags

Encrypted tags have the format: ~`key`=`b64encode aesgcm crypto string`, first 13 bytes are nonce. The key is the sharedkey of the content
If another cryptography method is used (e.g. key= tag of PrivateKey) then it should be not prefixed and manually encoded/decoded.
The helper expects a normal string and simply encrypts the string
